                        Products sent to addresses outside Europe without a BFPO number, could be liable to a small Internet-verifiable charge; depending on the locality. <br>
                        Depending on the locality, some foreign countries have an extremely bad postal service reputation and to overcome this problem, Col&amp;MacArthur will enter into a discussion with the customer to determine the best postal system to use. Insurance and/or special postal services may also lead to an additional charge. <br>
                        Delivery is done by mail or other transport services to the delivery address specified on the purchase page – when shipped to a locality other than a British or BFPO address, a reference shipment number will be sent to the customer (whenever possible) to track the shipment on the tracking website. <br>
                        In case of a non-withdrawal of the package by the client, (and following a "return to sender") the costs will be invoiced to the customer. <br>
                        In case of non-delivery of an order, you have two weeks from the date of departure of the product to contact Col&amp;MacArthur indicating the circumstances. Beyond this period, no claim will be accepted.

Under such circumstances, postal costs will be made liable to Col&amp;MacArthur and the exchange will be carried out as soon as possible depending on the availability of the product. <br>
                        Without prior agreement on the part of Col&amp;MacArthur, any returned item will not be exchanged. <br>
                        Following the written approval from Col&amp;MacArthur concerning a withdrawal or an exchange, the product must be returned in good condition, in its original packaging and without the slightest sign of having been used. <br>
                        Products with a manufacturing defect upon arrival will be exchanged in the fastest time possible in accordance to the above conditions. <br>
